		"question": "What are the products made of?",
		"answer": "<strong>Miracle Made® Sheets</strong> are made from our innovative <strong>Miracle Clean & Cool™</strong> fabrics which are NASA-inspired and silver-infused. Generation 1 of the product is made from premium long-staple cotton. Generation 2 of the product is made from a new, improved, premium Eucalyptus Lyocell blend. The majority of <strong>Miracle Made® Sheets</strong> shipping in 2023 are made from the Generation 2 product, though some colors still ship in Generation 1. Both generations of the product feel luxuriously soft and are infused with silver."

		"question": "How often do they have to be washed compared to regular sheets?",
		"answer": "Regular sheets typically are recommended to be washed weekly. However, doing so on a regular basis can be time-consuming for most people. That's why we offer bed sheets that prevent up to 99.7% of bacteria growth so they can be washed up to an estimated 3x times less than traditional sheets, helping you save time and keep clean!"

		"question": "How does silver help protect us?",
		"answer": "Silver is scientifically proven to help prevent bacterial growth. By infusing silver into our fabrics, our sheets are specially designed to help keep you clean and safe."

	{
		"question": "What is the thread count?",
		"answer": "The most recent generations of <strong>Miracle Made® Sheets</strong> are made with 300-thread-count fabrics to help give a premium and silky-soft feeling. Beware! Many brands selling sheets claiming a 1,000+ thread count are bending the truth and simply cutting the threads in their product to increase their thread count artificially. We stand behind our guarantee. Try <strong>Miracle Made® Sheets</strong> for 30 nights, and if you don't like them, send them back to us for a refund. No questions asked."
